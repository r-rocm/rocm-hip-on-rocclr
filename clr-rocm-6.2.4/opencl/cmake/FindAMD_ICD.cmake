# If people only use cmake to build this repo, ICD repo may not be built yet.
# As a result, ICD cannot be found because ICD does not exist.
# Take ocltst as an example how to build this repo under such scenario.
# ocltst cmake uses find_library command to find OpenCL. If find_library can't
# find ICD built by AMD, find_library command continue to search OpenCL
# installed in system. For example, find_library can find OpenCL installed by
# AMD rocm driver, /opt/rocm/lib/libOpenCL.so.
#
# Another solution is to build ICD loader first. Then install ICD loader into
# system. This solution is used by ROCM stack currently.
