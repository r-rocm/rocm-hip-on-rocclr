# AMD CLR - Compute Language Runtimes

AMD CLR (Common Language Runtime) contains source codes for AMD's compute languages runtimes: `HIP` and `OpenCL™`.

## Project Organisation

- `hipamd` - contains implementation of `HIP` language on AMD platform. It is hosted at [ROCm/clr/hipamd](https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/hipamd)
- `opencl` - contains implementation of [OpenCL™](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) on AMD platform. Now it is hosted at [ROCm/clr/opencl](https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/opencl)
- `rocclr` - contains common runtime used in `HIP` and `OpenCL™`. This is hosted at [ROCm/clr/rocclr](https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/rocclr)

## How to build/install

### Prerequisites

Please refer to Quick Start Guide in [ROCm Docs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html).

Building clr requires `rocm-hip-libraries` meta package, which provides the pre-requisites for clr.

### Linux

- Clone this repository
```
cd clr && mkdir build && cd build
```
- For HIP:

`cmake .. -DCLR_BUILD_HIP=ON -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_COMMON_DIR`


  `HIP_COMMON_DIR` points to [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm/HIP)

- For OpenCL™:

`cmake .. -DCLR_BUILD_OCL=ON`

- Build and install

```
make
make install
```

Users can also build `OCL` and `HIP` at the same time by passing `-DCLR_BUILD_HIP=ON -DCLR_BUILD_OCL=ON` to configure command.


For detail instructions, please refer to [how to build HIP](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/install/build.html)

## Tests

`hip-tests` is a separate repository hosted at [hip-tests](https://github.com/ROCm/hip-tests).

To run `hip-tests` please go to the repository and follow the steps.

## Release notes

HIP provides release notes in [CLR change log](./CHANGELOG.md), which has the records of changes in each release.
